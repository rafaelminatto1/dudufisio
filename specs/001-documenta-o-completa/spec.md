## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A physiotherapy clinic with 744+ patients and 23 daily appointments needs a comprehensive digital platform where administrators can manage operations, physiotherapists can document treatments and prescribe exercises, and patients can access their treatment plans and track progress. The system must handle patient records, appointment scheduling, treatment documentation, exercise libraries, body pain mapping, and generate clinical reports while maintaining medical data security and LGPD compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Patient Management Module
1. **Given** an administrator accessing the system, **When** they create a new patient record with required fields (name, CPF, birth date, phone, email), **Then** the system validates CPF format and creates the patient profile
2. **Given** a physiotherapist viewing a patient list, **When** they search by name, CPF, or phone number, **Then** the system returns filtered results with patient photos and key details
3. **Given** a patient record exists, **When** authorized users view the electronic medical record, **Then** they see anamnesis data, physical examination results, and treatment history

#### Body Mapping Module
4. **Given** a physiotherapist documenting a patient session, **When** they click on body regions in the interactive map, **Then** they can record pain points with 0-10 intensity scale and add annotations
5. **Given** pain points exist from previous sessions, **When** viewing the body map timeline, **Then** the system shows pain evolution with color-coded intensity changes over time

#### Scheduling System
6. **Given** available appointment slots, **When** staff schedules a new appointment, **Then** the system checks for conflicts and confirms the booking with automatic patient notifications
7. **Given** an existing appointment, **When** rescheduling is needed, **Then** the system finds available alternatives and updates all parties involved

#### Exercise Library & Prescription
8. **Given** the exercise library, **When** physiotherapists search by category or body region, **Then** they find exercises with video demonstrations, descriptions, and difficulty levels
9. **Given** a patient treatment plan, **When** exercises are prescribed, **Then** patients access their personalized exercise program through their portal with progress tracking

#### Reporting & Analytics
10. **Given** accumulated clinical data, **When** generating reports, **Then** the system produces professional clinical documents (progress reports, discharge summaries, insurance forms)
11. **Given** operational data, **When** accessing the dashboard, **Then** administrators see key metrics: active patients, daily appointments, revenue, treatment effectiveness

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a patient misses multiple appointments? (no-show tracking and policy enforcement)
- How does the system handle emergency appointment cancellations? (automated rescheduling and patient notifications)
- What occurs if a physiotherapist attempts to access a patient outside their assigned caseload? (role-based access control enforcement)
- How are data retention policies enforced for inactive patients? (automated archival and LGPD compliance)
- What happens during system maintenance when appointments need to be accessed? (offline capability and data synchronization)
